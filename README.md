> Hi guys! This is Team 2 project. We aimed to investigate the effects of parenting style and lifetime traumatic events on cortisol reactivity in middle childhood. To this end, we used the dataset from Jaffee et al. (2015). Multilevel models were used to analyse the data.

# Introduction

According to Pendry & Adam (2007), Cortisol levels are highly sensitive to social stressors and supports, such as close interpersonal relationships. Early exposure to harsh or unpredictable environments can disrupt the development of the stress-responding system, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Pendry & Adam, 2007). For example, negative expressivity and hostility in parents can influence arousal in children, leading to difficulties with planning and self-control (Hoffman, 2000). These challenges may, in turn, result in psychological dysregulation and physiological stress (Sturge-Apple et al., 2012; Doan et al,, 2012). Notaby, early stress can affect the structure and function of key brain areas that regulate the anticipation of and reaction to stressors (Herman et al., 2016). Specificially, maltreated youth tend to have significantly lower cortisol levels in childhood compared to controls (Gunnar et al., 2009; Shenk et al., 2010). Conversely, at later stage, adolescents with a history of maltreatment often exhibit heightened cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stressors (Harkness et al., 2011; Linares et al., 2013). These findings illustrate the complex and inconsistent nature of cortisol reactivity across development, as adverse experiences and environmental exposures can lead to both hyper-reactivity and hypo-reactivity in cortisol levels. To our knowledge, limited studies have explored at how parenting style at an early stage and the exposure of traumatic events in a lifetime can lead to changes in the cortisol levels in a longitudinal design. Taking into account the negative effect that early life adversity can bring, we aimed to explore how stress reponse, which indicated by cortisol reactivity, can be affected by parenting factors children had at a young age and the number of traumatic events they've experienced when they grew up into middle childhood. 

Complementing this, Jaffee et al. (2014) explored the interactive effects of early and recent stressful experiences on cortisol reactivity. Their study revealed that children's cortisol responses to stress are influenced by both early exposure to harsh, nonresponsive parenting and recent traumatic events. Children who experienced high levels of harsh parenting in early childhood and multiple recent traumatic events exhibited altered cortisol reactivity, which was also associated with increased internalising and externalising problems. Young et al. (2021) examined three theoretically important models that link developmental exposures to life stress and cortisol dysregulation: the cumulative stress model (which predicts effects for stress summed across the lifespan), the biological embedding model (which predicts effects for early life stress), and the sensitisation model (which predicts an early by current life stress interaction effect). The primary analyses revealed that both cumulative and early life stress led to blunted cortisol reactivity profiles, supporting the cumulative and biological embedding models. However, interactive effects of early stress and current stress was insignificant, and thus no support for the sensitisation model. Secondary analyses of this study revealed that greater stress in middle childhood also predicted blunted cortisol patterns, but this have been tested by Jaffee et al. (2014) by measuring recent traumatic events. Therefore, built upon these two studies, instead of focusing on recent stressful experiences, our study would explore the early stressful experience and total exposure to stressful events in life, as in line with the cumulative stress model and biological emobedding model.

**Hypotheses**

1. Parenting style i.e., supportive or harsh measured at age 3 would affect cortisol reactivity at age 10.​

2. Traumatic events that happened across lifetime (calculated at age 10) would affect cortisol reactivity at age 10.​

3. The interaction effect between parenting style measured at age 3 and lifetime traumatic events counted at age 10 would exert an effect on cortisol reactivity at age 10.



# Methods

**Participants**

Four hundred children were recruited from the National Evaluation of Sure Start's study. Children were first seen at the age of 3, and followed up at the age of 8 to 10.

**Procedure**

Cortisol level: cortisol was assessed from saliva samples, which were collected 20 minutes, 10 minutes, and at the end of the Social Provocation Task. At least 1 ml of passive drool was collected from participants.

Social Provocation Task: the task lasted for approximately minutes. Children were told they were going to play a video game against an opponent, who was actually a confederate. The task intended to provoke anger, frustration, and embarrassment in children. Children were instructed to undergo a practice round and two competitive rounds. Children were required to move the cursor to a target on the screen as quickly and accurately as possible. The practice round was designed so that the children performed poorly. The competitive rounds were designed so that the opponent always scored more points than the child could score in the previous rounds. Each round including the practice round finished with derogatory comments about the child's poor performance.

Children and parents were debriefed at the end of the study, but children were unaware that the game was manipulated.
