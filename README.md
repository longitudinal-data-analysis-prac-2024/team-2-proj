> Hi guys! This is Team 2 project. We aimed to investigate the effects of parenting style and lifetime traumatic events on cortisol reactivity in middle childhood. To this end, we used the dataset from Jaffee et al. (2015). Multilevel models were used to analyse the data.

# Introduction

According to Pendry & Adam (2007), Cortisol levels are highly sensitive to social stressors and supports, such as close interpersonal relationships. Early exposure to harsh or unpredictable environments can disrupt the development of the stress-responding system, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Pendry & Adam, 2007). For example, negative expressivity and hostility in parents can influence arousal in children, leading to difficulties with planning and self-control (Hoffman, 2000). These challenges may, in turn, result in psychological dysregulation and physiological stress (Sturge-Apple et al., 2012; Doan et al,, 2012). Notaby, early stress can affect the structure and function of key brain areas that regulate the anticipation of and reaction to stressors (Herman et al., 2016). Specificially, maltreated youth tend to have significantly lower cortisol levels in childhood compared to controls (Gunnar et al., 2009; Shenk et al., 2010). Conversely, at later stage, adolescents with a history of maltreatment often exhibit heightened cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stressors (Harkness et al., 2011; Linares et al., 2013). These findings illustrate the complex and inconsistent nature of cortisol reactivity across development, as adverse experiences and environmental exposures can lead to both hyper-reactivity and hypo-reactivity in cortisol levels. To our knowledge, limited studies have explored at how parenting style at an early stage and the exposure of traumatic events in a lifetime can lead to changes in the cortisol levels in a longitudinal design. Taking into account the negative effect that early life adversity can bring, we aimed to explore how stress reponse, which indicated by cortisol reactivity, can be affected by parenting factors children had at a young age and the number of traumatic events they've experienced when they grew up into middle childhood. 

Complementing this, Jaffee et al. (2014) explored the interactive effects of early and recent stressful experiences on cortisol reactivity. Their study revealed that children's cortisol responses to stress are influenced by both early exposure to harsh, nonresponsive parenting and recent traumatic events. Children who experienced high levels of harsh parenting in early childhood and multiple recent traumatic events exhibited altered cortisol reactivity, which was also associated with increased internalising and externalising problems. Young et al. (2021) examined three theoretically important models that link developmental exposures to life stress and cortisol dysregulation: the cumulative stress model (which predicts effects for stress summed across the lifespan), the biological embedding model (which predicts effects for early life stress), and the sensitisation model (which predicts an early by current life stress interaction effect). The primary analyses revealed that both cumulative and early life stress led to blunted cortisol reactivity profiles, supporting the cumulative and biological embedding models. However, interactive effects of early stress and current stress was insignificant, and thus no support for the sensitisation model. Secondary analyses of this study revealed that greater stress in middle childhood also predicted blunted cortisol patterns, but this have been tested by Jaffee et al. (2014) by measuring recent traumatic events. Therefore, built upon these two studies, instead of focusing on recent stressful experiences, our study would explore the early stressful experience and total exposure to stressful events in life, as in line with the cumulative stress model and biological emobedding model.

**Hypotheses**

Due to the inconsistent results from previous studies, we made 3 non-directional hypotheses. 

1. Parenting style i.e., supportive or harsh measured at age 3 would affect cortisol reactivity at age 8 to 10.​

2. Traumatic events that happened across lifetime (calculated at age 8 to 10) would affect cortisol reactivity at age 8 to 10.​

3. The interaction effect between parenting style measured at age 3 and lifetime traumatic events counted at age 10 would exert an effect on cortisol reactivity at age 8 to 10.


# Methods

**Design**

Between-subject longtitudinal design, as cortisol levels are measured repeatedly. 

**Participants**

Four hundred children were recruited from the National Evaluation of Sure Start's cross-sectional study. Children were first seen at the age of 3, and followed up at the age of 8 to 10. Children were recruited based on their experiences of harsh and non-supportive parenting at age 3. Harsh discipline was measured with 9 items from the parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus et al., 1998). Supporting parenting was assessed using the eight questions on the Responsive Parenting subscale from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984). To determine the parenting styles the children experienced, the sample was divided into two groups: high risk families were selected if they were in the top tercile of the harsh parenting variable and the bottom half of the responsivity / supportive parenting variable; low risk families were selected if they were in the bottom tercile of the harsh discipline variable and the top half of the responsivity variable. Families who were selected from the middle tercile of both variables were categorised as moderate risk families, and this kind of families was combined with low risk families for analyses. 

**Measure**

The number of lifetime traumatic events was counted only when caregiver and child both reported the happenings. 

Cortisol levels were measured from saliva samples obtained via passive drool using Salimetrics cryovials. Children were instructed to avoid vigorous exercise and consuming snacks or dairy products after midday on the testing day. Saliva was collected at six specific times: 20 and 10 minutes before the SP task, at the end of the SP task, and 20, 45, and 65 minutes after the task. For children who did not participate in round 2 of the SP task, the saliva collection timing remained the same, except they did not provide a sample at the end of the task. A seventh sample, collected before bedtime and sent back, was typically not used due to high variability.

The samples were analyzed using the Salimetrics™ Cortisol hormone kit, a competitive immunoassay validated for salivary cortisol measurement. Samples were measured in duplicate, maintaining a coefficient of variation below 10%. Outliers were adjusted using winsorisation, and natural log transformations were applied to normalise the cortisol concentration distributions.

**Procedure**
Based on studies of Fairchild et al. (2008) and Van Goozen et al. (1998), a social provocation task (SP) was conducted with the study children during the home visit to assess variations in physiological stress response to induced psychosocial stress, as indicated by cortisol concentration and autonomic nervous system activity, along with individual subjective responses.  

The task was introduced approximately 55 minutes into the visit and lasted for about 30 minutes. Children were told they were going to play a video game against an online opponent, visible via a webcam. This opponent was actually a confederate who had been previously recorded participating in the SP task. The opponent was the same age and sex as the participant.

At the start of the task, participants and their opponents were fitted with blood pressure cuffs, and the participants were told they would play a video game against the opponent. The game included a 2-minute practice round followed by two competitive 3-minute rounds, observed by the opponent. The game concluded with a round played by the opponent, and the winner would receive £10. The game was rigged to ensure participants performed poorly in the practice round and competitive rounds, and the opponent always outscored them in the final round.

Each round was followed by a prerecorded video message from the opponent with derogatory and taunting comments about the participant’s performance, to which the participant could respond. After the SP task, participants completed an easy task for about 5 minutes to ensure success. At the study's conclusion, participants and their parents were debriefed, and participants were unaware that the game had been rigged.

# Results

In our analysis of the impact of early childhood parenting styles and lifetime traumatic events on cortisol reactivity, we conducted a series of analyses using a well-defined cohort. The dataset, after verification of key variables and handling missing data, included measures of financial hardship, socio-economic status (SES), and trauma exposure, alongside cortisol measurements at multiple timepoints.

**Descriptive Statistics within Different Groups**

Descriptive statistics revealed variations in financial hardship, SES, and trauma across high risk and moderate/low risk groups, as detailed below:
Moderate/Low Risk Group:
Financial Hardship: M=8.59, SD=4.20
SES: M=0.07, SD=0.82 
Trauma Lifetime: M=1.11, SD=1.19
High Risk Group:
Financial Hardship: M=10.23, SD=4.62
SES: M=-0.20, SD=0.71
Trauma Lifetime: M=1.61, SD=1.57
Descriptive statistics also revealed distinct patterns in cortisol levels across the six time points, indicating variability in cortisol reactivity which might be influenced by underlying parenting styles.

**Cortisol Levels Over Time**

The longitudinal data format allowed us to assess cortisol levels over multiple timepoints. We observed that cortisol levels varied over time as showed below, with descriptive analysis indicating fluctuations in mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median levels.


**Table 2 Summary of Cortisol Level Changes Over Time**

| Timepoint | Mean Distance | SD Distance | Min Distance | Max Distance | Median Distance |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1.00      | 15.06         | 1.62        | 10.25        | 19.26        | 15.58           |
| 2.00      | 15.27         | 1.64        | 10.35        | 19.36        | 16.12           |
| 3.00      | 15.83         | 1.63        | 11.05        | 20.07        | 16.41           |
| 4.00      | 16.07         | 1.64        | 11.15        | 20.18        | 16.57           |
| 5.00      | 16.36         | 1.64        | 11.35        | 20.29        | 17.17           |
| 6.00      | 16.54         | 1.64        | 11.45        | 20.36        | 17.25           |

Visual analyses, including box plots (figure 1) and trajectory plots (figure 2), were utilised to further dissect the relationship between risk groups and cortisol levels. 
The median cortisol levels at different timepoints show a consistent pattern of slightly increases across the timepoints within each risk group, suggesting relatively increasing cortisol levels across these measurements.
Both risk groups display a similar range of variability in cortisol levels, as indicated by the spread and overlap of the IQRs across the timepoints. There is no immediately apparent systematic difference in the level of cortisol between the positive or harsh parenting groups. There are several outliers in both groups across different timepoints, indicating some individual measurements that are significantly higher or lower than the majority. These could represent individual differences in cortisol reactivity or measurement errors and may warrant further investigation.

## Linear Mixed-Effects Modeling
The model comparison indicated that there were no significant differences between the two models. The model with fixed slope and interaction demonstrated slightly better performance (AIC =5639.7, BIC =5685.4). Therefore, we selected this model for our analysis.

A linear mixed-effects model was applied to explore the influences of parenting styles and lifetime trauma events on cortisol levels, with random effects accounting for variability across individuals. Financial hardship and SES are included as control variables in the model to account for their potential confounding effects.​

The model's AIC (0.87) and BIC (0.86) indicated a good fit relative to the complexity.
However, fixed effects of lifetime trauma (p=.79), parenting style (p=.70) did not show significant impact on cortisol levels.

There is also no significant interaction between lifetime trauma and parenting style (p=.69).​ Therefore the null hypotheses are accepted.

# Discussion

## Interpretation of Findings

The lack of significant findings from the linear mixed-effects model challenges our initial hypotheses regarding the impact of early-life risk factors and trauma on cortisol reactivity. This could be attributed to several factors:

**Statistical Power and Sample Characteristics**: One possible explanation for the lack of significant findings could be related to statistical power. Although our sample size was adequate to detect moderate to large effects, it is possible that the true effects, if they exist, are smaller than our study was powered to detect. Additionally, the variability within our sample regarding exposure to trauma or the degree of supportiveness or harshness of parenting might not have been wide enough to capture subtle effects.

**Measurement Issues**: The tools used to measure both parenting style and traumatic events might not have captured the nuances necessary to detect an influence on cortisol reactivity. Parenting style, for instance, was classified broadly as supportive or harsh without considering the consistency of parenting or the possible presence of other parenting styles that might mitigate or exacerbate the expected effects. Similarly, the measure of traumatic events might not have adequately captured the severity or emotional impact of these events on the child.

**Developmental Timing**: The timing of the measurements could also be a factor. While we measured parenting style at age 3, developmental changes and other intervening experiences up to age 10 might dilute or alter the initial influence of early parenting. Similarly, the effect of traumatic events on physiological stress responses can vary depending on the proximity to the event, individual resilience, and available social support systems, none of which were controlled for in the current study.
Confounding Variables: Other unmeasured variables such as genetic predispositions, social support, or concurrent stressors might have confounded the relationships explored. These factors could include familial mental health, or other environmental stressors not accounted for in our study.

## Broader Implications

Despite the non-significant findings, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the physiological impacts of early-life experiences and socio-economic factors. It underscores the need for more nuanced research approaches that consider complex interactions between genetic markers and environmental influences. Furthermore, the high variability in cortisol responses observed suggests that individual differences play a crucial role in stress physiology, advocating for personalized approaches in psychological and behavioral interventions.

Future research should aim to incorporate more detailed longitudinal data, perhaps extending beyond the initial childhood years to capture long-term trends and delayed effects. Additionally, incorporating qualitative data could enrich the understanding of how perceived stress and coping mechanisms influence cortisol dynamics. Lastly, exploring machine learning techniques may unveil non-linear relationships and interactions that traditional statistical methods might overlook.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this study highlights the complexities of studying cortisol reactivity and its predictors. The findings suggest a reconsideration of how early-life experiences are measured and suggest a potential reevaluation of the factors that significantly impact physiological stress responses over time.
