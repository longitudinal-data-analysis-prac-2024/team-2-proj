> Hi guys! This is Team 2 project. We aimed to investigate the effects of parenting style and lifetime traumatic events on cortisol reactivity in middle childhood. To this end, we used the dataset from Jaffee et al. (2015). Multilevel models were used to analyse the data.

# Introduction

According to Pendry & Adam (2007), Cortisol levels are highly sensitive to social stressors and supports, such as close interpersonal relationships. Early exposure to harsh or unpredictable environments can disrupt the development of the stress-responding system, increasing the risk for mental health problems (Pendry & Adam, 2007). For example, negative expressivity and hostility in parents can influence arousal in children, leading to difficulties with planning and self-control (Hoffman, 2000). These challenges may, in turn, result in psychological dysregulation and physiological stress (Sturge-Apple et al., 2012; Doan et al,, 2012). Notaby, early stress can affect the structure and function of key brain areas that regulate the anticipation of and reaction to stressors (Herman et al., 2016). Specificially, maltreated youth tend to have significantly lower cortisol levels in childhood compared to controls (Gunnar et al., 2009; Shenk et al., 2010). Conversely, at later stage, adolescents with a history of maltreatment often exhibit heightened cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stressors (Harkness et al., 2011; Linares et al., 2013). These findings illustrate the complex and inconsistent nature of cortisol reactivity across development, as adverse experiences and environmental exposures can lead to both hyper-reactivity and hypo-reactivity in cortisol levels. To our knowledge, limited studies have explored at how parenting style at an early stage and the exposure of traumatic events in a lifetime can lead to changes in the cortisol levels in a longitudinal design. Taking into account the negative effect that early life adversity can bring, we aimed to explore how stress reponse, which indicated by cortisol reactivity, can be affected by parenting factors children had at a young age and the number of traumatic events they've experienced when they grew up into middle childhood. 

Complementing this, Jaffee et al. (2014) explored the interactive effects of early and recent stressful experiences on cortisol reactivity. Their study revealed that children's cortisol responses to stress are influenced by both early exposure to harsh, nonresponsive parenting and recent traumatic events. Children who experienced high levels of harsh parenting in early childhood and multiple recent traumatic events exhibited altered cortisol reactivity, which was also associated with increased internalising and externalising problems. Young et al. (2021) examined three theoretically important models that link developmental exposures to life stress and cortisol dysregulation: the cumulative stress model (which predicts effects for stress summed across the lifespan), the biological embedding model (which predicts effects for early life stress), and the sensitisation model (which predicts an early by current life stress interaction effect). The primary analyses revealed that both cumulative and early life stress led to blunted cortisol reactivity profiles, supporting the cumulative and biological embedding models. However, interactive effects of early stress and current stress was insignificant, and thus no support for the sensitisation model. Secondary analyses of this study revealed that greater stress in middle childhood also predicted blunted cortisol patterns, but this have been tested by Jaffee et al. (2014) by measuring recent traumatic events. Therefore, built upon these two studies, instead of focusing on recent stressful experiences, our study would explore the early stressful experience and total exposure to stressful events in life, as in line with the cumulative stress model and biological emobedding model.

**Hypotheses**

1. Parenting style i.e., supportive or harsh measured at age 3 would affect cortisol reactivity at age 8 to 10.​

2. Traumatic events that happened across lifetime (calculated at age 8 to 10) would affect cortisol reactivity at age 8 to 10.​

3. The interaction effect between parenting style measured at age 3 and lifetime traumatic events counted at age 10 would exert an effect on cortisol reactivity at age 8 to 10.



# Methods

**Design**

Between-subject experimental design. 

**Participants**

Four hundred children were recruited from the National Evaluation of Sure Start's cross-sectional study. Children were first seen at the age of 3, and followed up at the age of 8 to 10. Children were recruited based on their experiences of harsh and non-supportive parenting at age 3. Harsh discipline was measured with 9 items from the parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus et al., 1998). Supporting parenting was assessed using the eight questions on the Responsive Parenting subscale from the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984). To determine the parenting styles the children experienced, the sample was divided into two groups: high risk families were selected if they were in the top tercile of the harsh parenting variable and the bottom half of the responsivity / supportive parenting variable; low risk families were selected if they were in the bottom tercile of the harsh discipline variable and the top half of the responsivity variable. Families who were selected from the middle tercile of both variables were categorised as moderate risk families, and this kind of families was combined with low risk families for analyses.
